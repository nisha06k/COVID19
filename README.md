The aim of the project was good prediction

Data Cleaning: Deleting rows with null values and columns not needed for this analysis, and converting data types, Encoding.
Data Validation and Exploration: I used Python for Data Exploration(Barchart and Heatmap), separating dependent and independent variables And splitting the data into train and test
Accuracy: Used Machine learning for model training, evaluated data using test data, Feature Scaling and Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
SQL: SQL is also used to find some values.
Result: The highest accuracy from the Decision Tree is 84.
